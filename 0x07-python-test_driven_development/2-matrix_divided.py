"""A module that divides all elements of a matrix
This module contains matrix_divided function,
that divides all elements of a matrix according
to a divisor given. for the program to work, the
following conditions must be accounted for:
    * Matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats.
    * Each row of the matrix must be of the same size.
    * The divisor must be an integer or a float and must not
     be equal to zero.
    * The divisor should be rounded off to 2 decimal places.
    * The result is delivered in a new matrix.
