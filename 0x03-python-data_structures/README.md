# 0x03-python-data_structures

##### Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.

***Tasks***

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: a function that prints all integers of a list.
